# Amazon SageMaker Autopilot model deployment and prediction<a name="autopilot-deploy-models"></a>

This Amazon SageMaker Autopilot guide includes steps for model deployment, setting up real\-time inference, and running inference with batch jobs\. 

After you train your SageMaker Autopilot models, you can deploy them to get predictions in one of two ways:

1. Use [Real\-time inferencing](autopilot-deploy-models-realtime.md) to set up an endpoint and obtain predictions interactively\.

1. Use [Batch inferencing](autopilot-deploy-models-batch.md) to make predictions in parallel on batches of observations on an entire dataset\.

**Note**  
To avoid incurring unnecessary charges: After the endpoints and resources that were created from model deployment are longer needed, you can delete them\. For information about pricing of instances by Region, see [Amazon SageMaker Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/)\.

# Batch Ingestion Spark Connector Setup<a name="batch-ingestion-spark-connector-setup"></a>

## Introduction<a name="batch-ingestion-spark-connector-introduction"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Feature Store supports batch data ingestion with Spark, using your existing ETL pipeline\. It can be a pipeline on Amazon EMR, GIS, a AWS Glue Job, a Amazon SageMaker Processing job, or a SageMaker Notebook\.

Methods for installing and implementing batch data ingestion are provided for Python and Scala\. Python developers can use the `sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark` Python library for local development and installation on Amazon EMR\. They can also run it from their Jupyter Notebooks\. Scala developers can use the Feature Store Spark connector available in Maven\.

You can use the Spark connector to ingest data in the following ways:

1. Ingest by default – Ingest your dataframe into the online store\. When you use the connector to update the online store, the Spark connector uses the [PutRecord](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_feature_store_PutRecord.html) operation to make the update\. Within 15 minutes, Feature Store replicates the data from the online store to the offline store\. The online store contains the latest value for the record\. For more information about how the online and offline stores work, see [Feature Store Concepts](feature-store-getting-started.md#feature-store-concepts)\.

1. Offline store direct ingestion – Use the Spark connector to ingest your dataframe directly into the offline store\. Ingesting the dataframe directly into the offline store doesn't update the online store\.

For information about using the different ingestion methods, see [Example Implementations](#batch-ingestion-spark-connector-example-implementations)\.

## Installation<a name="batch-ingestion-spark-connector-installation"></a>

 **Scala Users** 

 ****Requirements**** 
+  Spark >= 3\.0\.0 and <= 3\.3\.0
+ iceberg\-spark\-runtime >= 0\.14\.0
+  Scala >= 2\.12\.x  
+  Amazon EMR >= 6\.1\.0 \(only if you are using Amazon EMR\) 

 **Declare the Dependency in POM\.xml** 

 The Feature Store Spark connector has a dependency on the `iceberg-spark-runtime` library\. You must therefore add corresponding version of the `iceberg-spark-runtime` library to the dependency if you're ingesting data into a feature group that you've auto\-created with the Iceberg table format\. The Feature Store Spark connector is available in the [Maven central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.sagemaker.featurestore/sagemaker-feature-store-spark-sdk)\. For example, if you're using Spark 3\.1, you must declare the following in your project’s `POM.xml`: 

```
 <dependency>
 <groupId>software.amazon.sagemaker.featurestore</groupId>
 <artifactId>sagemaker-feature-store-spark-sdk_2.12</artifactId>
 <version>1.0.0</version>
 </dependency>
 
 <dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.iceberg</groupId>
   <artifactId>iceberg-spark-runtime-3.1_2.12</artifactId>
   <version>0.14.0</version>
</dependency>
```

 **Python Users** 

 ****Requirements**** 
+  Spark >= 3\.0\.0 and <= 3\.3\.0
+  Amazon EMR >= 6\.1\.0 \(only if you are using Amazon EMR\) 
+ Kernel = `conda_python3`

We recommend setting the `$SPARK_HOME` to the directory where you have Spark installed\. During installation, Feature Store uploads the required jar to `SPARK_HOME`, so that the dependencies load automatically\. Spark starting a JVM is required to make this PySpark library work\.

 **Local Installation** 

 To find more info about the installation, enable verbose mode by appending `--verbose` to the following installation command\. 

```
pip3 install sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1 --no-binary :all:
```

 **Installation on Amazon EMR** 

Create an Amazon EMR cluster with the release version 6\.1\.0 or later\. Enable SSH to help you troubleshoot any issues\.

You can do one of the following to install the library:
+ Create a custom step within Amazon EMR\.
+ SSH into your cluster and install the library from there\.

You can either create a custom step within EMR to start installing the library or SSH into your cluster to install the library directly in console\.

**Note**  
The following information uses Spark version 3\.1, but you can specify any version that meets the requirements\.

```
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/lib/spark
sudo -E pip3 install sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1 --no-binary :all: --verbose
```

**Note**  
If you want to install the dependent jars automatically to SPARK\_HOME, do not use the bootstrap step\.

 **Installation on a SageMaker Notebook** 

Install a version of PySpark that's compatible with the Spark connector using the following commands:

```
!pip3 install pyspark==3.1.1 
!pip3 install sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1 --no-binary :all:
```

If you're performing batch ingestion to the offline store, the dependencies aren't within the notebook instance environment\.

```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import feature_store_pyspark

extra_jars = ",".join(feature_store_pyspark.classpath_jars())

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .config("spark.jars", extra_jars) \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.2.1,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:3.2.1") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

 **Installation on Notebooks with GIS** 

**Important**  
You must use AWS Glue Version 2\.0 or later to install the Spark connector on the AWS Glue Interactive Session\.

Use the following information to help you install the PySpark Connector in an AWS Glue Interactive Session\.

The Amazon SageMaker Feature Store Spark Connector requires specific Spark connector JARs during the initialization of the session\. You can upload them to your Amazon S3 bucket\. After you’ve uploaded them, you must provide the GIS sessions with the JARs using the following command\.

```
%extra_jars s3://spark-connector-jars/sagemaker-feature-store-spark-sdk.jar
```

To install the Spark Connector in the AWS Glue runtime, use the `%additional_python_modules` magic command within the GIS notebook\. AWS Glue runs pip to the modules that you’ve specified under `%additional_python_modules`\.

```
%additional_python_modules sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1
```

Before you start the AWS Glue session, you must use both of the preceding magic commands\.

 **Installation on an AWS Glue Job** 

**Important**  
You must use AWS Glue Version 2\.0 or later to install the Spark connector on the AWS Glue Interactive Session\.

To install the Spark connect on a AWS Glue job, use the `--extra-jars` method to provide the necessary Jars and `--additional-python-modules` to install the Spark Connector as job parameters when you create the AWS Glue job as shown in the following example\. 

```
glue_client = boto3.client('glue', region_name=region)
response = glue_client.create_job(
    Name=pipeline_id,
    Description='Feature Store Compute Job',
    Role=glue_role_arn,
    ExecutionProperty={'MaxConcurrentRuns': max_concurrent_run},
    Command={
        'Name': 'glueetl',
        'ScriptLocation': script_location_uri,
        'PythonVersion': '3'
    },
    DefaultArguments={
        '--TempDir': temp_dir_location_uri,
        '--additional-python-modules': 'sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1',
        '--extra-jars': "s3://spark-connector-jars/sagemaker-feature-store-spark-sdk.jar",
        ...
    },
    MaxRetries=3,
    NumberOfWorkers=149,
    Timeout=2880,
    GlueVersion='3.0',
    WorkerType='G.2X'
)
```

 **Installation on a Amazon SageMaker Processing Job** 

To use the Feature Store Spark Connector with Amazon SageMaker Processing jobs, bring your own image\. For more information about bringing your image, see [Bring your own SageMaker image](studio-byoi.md)\. Add the installation step to a Dockerfile\. After you've pushed the docker image to an Amazon ECR repository, you can use the PySparkProcessor to create the processing job\. For more information about creating a processing job with the PySpark processor, see [Data Processing with Apache Spark](use-spark-processing-container.md)\.

The following is an example of adding an installation step to the Dockerfile\.

```
FROM account-id.dkr.ecr.AWS Region.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-spark-processing:3.1-cpu-py38-v1.0

RUN /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1 --no-binary :all: --verbose
```

 **Retrieving the JAR for the Spark Connector** 

To retrieve the Spark connector dependency Jar, you must install the Spark connector from the Python Package Index \(PyPI\) repository using pip in any Python environment with network access\. A SageMaker Jupyter Notebook is an example of a Python environment with network access\.

The following command installs the Spark connector\.

```
!pip install sagemaker-feature-store-pyspark-3.1      
```

After you've installed the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store PySpark connector, you can retrieve the Jar that the installation in your notebook directory and upload it to Amazon S3\.

The `feature-store-pyspark-dependency-jars` command provides a list of locations for all of the necessary dependency jars that the Spark connector added\. You can use the command to retrieve the Jar and upload it to Amazon S3\.

```
jar_location = !feature-store-pyspark-dependency-jars
jar_location = jar_location[0]

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
s3_client.upload_file(jar_location, "feature-store-spark-connector","spark-connector-jars/sagemaker-feature-store-spark-sdk.jar")
```

```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from feature_store_pyspark.FeatureStoreManager import FeatureStoreManager
import feature_store_pyspark

spark = SparkSession.builder \
                    .getOrCreate()

```

 **Submit a Spark Job** 

 **Scala** 

 You should be able to use the Spark connector as a normal dependency\. No extra instruction is needed to run the application on all platforms\. 

 **Python** 

 The PySpark version requires an extra dependent jar to be imported, so extra steps are needed to run the Spark application\. 

 If you did not specify `SPARK_HOME` during installation, then you have to load required jars in JVM when running `spark-submit`\. `feature-store-pyspark-dependency-jars` is a Python script installed by the Spark library to automatically fetch the path to all jars for you\. 

```
spark-submit --jars `feature-store-pyspark-dependency-jars` FeatureStoreBatchIngestion.py
```

 If you are running this application on Amazon EMR, it’s recommended to run the application in client mode, so that you do not need to distribute the dependent jars to other task nodes\. Add one more step in Amazon EMR cluster with Spark argument like this: 

```
spark-submit --deploy-mode client --master yarn s3://<path-to-script>/FeatureStoreBatchIngestion.py
```

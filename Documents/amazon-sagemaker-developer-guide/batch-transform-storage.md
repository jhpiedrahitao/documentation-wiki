# Storage in Batch Transform<a name="batch-transform-storage"></a>

When you run a batch transform job, Amazon SageMaker attaches an Amazon Elastic Block Store storage volume to Amazon EC2 instances that process your job\. The volume stores your model, and the size of the storage volume is fixed at 30 GB\. You have the option to encrypt your model at rest in the storage volume\.

**Note**  
If you have a large model, you may encounter an `InternalServerError`\.

# Amazon SageMaker Clarify Bias Detection and Model Explainability<a name="clarify-configure-processing-jobs"></a>

This topic describes how to configure an Amazon SageMaker Clarify processing job which can compute bias metrics and feature attributions for explainability\. Clarify processing jobs are implemented using a specialized SageMaker Clarify container image\. The following **Topics** list contains instructions on how to configure, run and troubleshoot a Clarify processing job and how to configure an analysis\. 

For additional information about bias metrics, explainability and how to interpret them, see [Learn How Amazon SageMaker Clarify Helps Detect Bias](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/learn-how-amazon-sagemaker-clarify-helps-detect-bias), [Fairness Measures for Machine Learning in Finance](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/Fairness.Measures.for.Machine.Learning.in.Finance.pdf), and the [Amazon AI Fairness and Explainability Whitepaper](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/Amazon.AI.Fairness.and.Explainability.Whitepaper.pdf)\.

## Sample Notebooks<a name="clarify-post-training-bias-model-explainability-sample-notebooks"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Clarify provides the following sample notebooks for post\-training bias detection and model explainability:
+ [Fairness and Explainability with SageMaker Clarify](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability.html) â€“ Use SageMaker Clarify to create a processing job for detecting bias and explaining model predictions with feature attributions\. You can also see [an example notebook to read a dataset in JSON Lines format](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability_jsonlines_format.html)\.
+ Additional example notebooks using Clarify include the following

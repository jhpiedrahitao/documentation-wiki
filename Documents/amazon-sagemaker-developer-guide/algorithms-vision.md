# Built\-in SageMaker Algorithms for Computer Vision<a name="algorithms-vision"></a>

SageMaker provides image processing algorithms that are used for image classification, object detection, and computer vision\.
+ [Image Classification \- MXNet](image-classification.md)—uses example data with answers \(referred to as a *supervised algorithm*\)\. Use this algorithm to classify images\.
+ [Image Classification \- TensorFlow](image-classification-tensorflow.md)—uses pretrained TensorFlow Hub models to fine\-tune for specific tasks \(referred to as a *supervised algorithm*\)\. Use this algorithm to classify images\.
+ [Object Detection \- MXNet](object-detection.md)—detects and classifies objects in images using a single deep neural network\. It is a supervised learning algorithm that takes images as input and identifies all instances of objects within the image scene\.
+ [Object Detection \- TensorFlow](object-detection-tensorflow.md)—detects bounding boxes and object labels in an image\. It is a supervised learning algorithm that supports transfer learning with available pretrained TensorFlow models\.
+ [Semantic Segmentation Algorithm](semantic-segmentation.md)—provides a fine\-grained, pixel\-level approach to developing computer vision applications\.

4|What is the purpose of the 'StoppingCondition' in a monitoring job?|The 'StoppingCondition' is a time limit for how long the monitoring job is allowed to run before stopping.|gpt-3.5-turbo|The purpose of the 'StoppingCondition' in a monitoring job is to specify a limit on how long the job can run. When the job reaches the specified time limit, SageMaker will automatically end the monitoring job. This helps to cap the costs associated with the monitoring job and ensures that it does not run indefinitely. Additionally, when the job is stopped, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. This allows algorithms to save the model artifacts within this window, preventing the loss of training results.
